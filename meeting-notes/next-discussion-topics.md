# Project Scope
- I'm thinking we are taking on too much new stuff to be successful
- Larua and Sharmina have testing
- Karl and Maddie are sharing React & Node.js
- We all need to learn React which involves a different way of doing CSS. It doesn't seem too hard to learn but is another new thing.
- Node.js includes a templating engine that needs to be learned as well

- To address the scope problem should we add 1 or 2 people to the team.
- 1. Reduce the scope
- 2.

# Solving the scope problem
Project management says you can change scope, resources and/or time. Which do we want to do?
1. Add 2 people. Maybe one with low experience but available time and enthusiasm and another more senior who is willing to dig into some of the tough spots.
2. I think we loosely agreed we want a 3 to 4 month time line. Should we make it longer.
3. Should we reduce scope?
    - Build a more traditional web app?
    - Use SQL (we know it already) instead of MongoDB (we don't know it)?
    - Take Node.js out
    - Alternative, build something very small that employs all the needed technologies but doesn't really do much. This way we get to try each technology and see how hard it is before we commit to something more that might never get finished?

## Technology projects are a can of worms
- Should we cut back our scope?
- Maybe we should build a more traditional web application?
- Or should we try to build something very small and simple using all the technologies the larger project would use, see how it goes and then decide from there?

# Technology
- Express
- Templating engine
- MongoDB v Relational

# Use of git
- number of repositories
- we need to learn branching

# Book
- [React Speed Coding](https://leanpub.com/reactspeedcoding) - This is a book Maddie found. It seems to encompass much of the project structure and skills we need. Should we all work on it?

# FCC
- How to keep our FCC work moving forward and learn all the new stuff for the project at the same time?
